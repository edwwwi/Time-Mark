# Time-Mark
TimeMark helps you quickly record moments of your day by saving the exact time with a short note. Designed for simplicity, it lets you track daily activities, view them on a clean calendar, and build a personal time-based routine — all offline.
TimeMark is a minimal Android application designed to help users record and organize daily time-based activities effortlessly.
The core idea of the app is to allow users to quickly mark what they did at a specific time, such as:

“7:30 PM – Got bus”
“9:00 AM – Reached college”

Unlike complex scheduling or reminder apps, TimeMark focuses purely on recording time events, helping users understand their daily routine and prepare better schedules in the future.

The app displays a live current time at the top of the screen, followed by a clean calendar interface that allows users to select any date and view or add time entries for that day.
Each entry is intentionally kept short (single-line text) to ensure fast input and minimal cognitive load.

All data is stored locally on the device, ensuring offline access, privacy, and simplicity.
The app supports dark mode and follows a modern, minimal UI design to provide a comfortable user experience.
