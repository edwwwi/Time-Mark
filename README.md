# TimeMark ⏱️

TimeMark is a minimal Android app that helps you quickly record moments of your day by saving the exact time with a short note. It is designed for simplicity, allowing you to track daily activities, view them on a clean calendar, and build a personal time-based routine — all while working completely offline.

## 📌 About the App

TimeMark allows users to quickly mark what they did at a specific time, for example:

- 7:30 PM – Got bus  
- 9:00 AM – Reached college  

Unlike complex scheduling or reminder apps, TimeMark focuses purely on recording time events. This helps users better understand their daily routines and prepare improved schedules based on real activity data.

The app displays a **live current time** at the top of the screen, followed by a **clean calendar interface**. Users can select any date to view or add time-based entries for that day.

Each entry is intentionally kept short (single-line text) to ensure fast input and minimal cognitive load.

All data is stored **locally on the device**, ensuring offline access, privacy, and simplicity. The app supports **dark mode** and follows a modern, minimal UI design.
